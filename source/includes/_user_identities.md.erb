# User Identities

User identities are attached to RedSeed <a href="/#user">Users</a> to allow integration with remote identity providers like OKTA, Azure, Netsuite, etc. as well as many other openID and oauth2 compatible service providers.

User identities are used to approve single sign on to the RedSeed LMS from remote identity providers and to create and update users during SSO or on demand.

## Client Attributes
