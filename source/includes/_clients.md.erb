# Clients

RedSeed is a multi-tenanted application. All resources are partitioned by Client.

Some resources are shared to many clients, others belong to a single client only. When you make a RedSeed API request you are limited to resources available to your client only.

## Client Attributes

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
`id` | uuid | A version 4 universally unique identifier generated by RedSeed when a client is created | true
`status` | 'Active', 'Inactive' | Client status
`name` | text | Client name
`dateStarted` | datetime | The datetime the client started using RedSeed. Set manually by RedSeed staff after launch.
`dateEngagement` | datetime | The datetime that training engagement data starts for the client
`dateCreatedAt` | datetime | The datetime the client resource was created at
`dateUpdatedAt` | datetime | The datetime the client resource was last updated
