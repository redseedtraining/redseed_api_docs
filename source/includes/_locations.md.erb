# Locations

Client locations represent a clients physical locations, e.g. Countries, Regions, Stores & Deparments as well as logical groups. A Client's location structure often mirrors their business organisational units for reporting purposes.

Locations are structured in a tree hierarchy, RedSeed does not currently provide API access to move locations and their children. Please contact RedSeed support if you need to alter your location hierarchy.

Locations house users, and are used to allow or restrict access to <a href="/#users">Users</a>, <a href="/#courses">Courses</a> and <a href="/#pathways">Pathways</a> and many other RedSeed resources. They also accumulate training engagement for all users at that location and below when users are active / inactive in courses.

Most RedSeed reports support segmenting by location.
